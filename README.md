# cpcbuilder
Basic Qt-based IDE for building Amstrad CPC assembly language programs


Builds on Linux, with Qt 4.6 or later (Tested on Ubuntu)
Should build on other Qt supported OSes also.

To build:
  qmake ide.pro
  make

Requires Pasmo to be in your system path, which is used for assembling Z80 ASM code.

This application is fairly basic, written mostly as an exercise in learning Qt.  I will work on it as time and mood allows.
